## about me

Art, health, and social advocacy have always inspired me. In a past life, I worked in performing arts administration with organizations such as Galapagos Art Space, The World Science Festival, The Bindlestiff Family Cirkus and The Westside Theatre. Now, as a fullstack software engineer, I strive to build technology that expands creative expression and social good.

Currently, I spend my time writing code to help folks connect with lawmakers, practicing British baking recipes (chocolate babka is one of my favorites), and keeping <a href="https://www.instagram.com/myfriendstevienips/" target="_blank">Stevie Nips entertained</a>. I also enjoy finding DIY spaces and unusual and discovering new music.

## preferred tech stack

javascript, html, css, kotlin, spring, vue, node, express, react, redux, postgresql, elasticsearch, aws and probably more by the time you read this.
